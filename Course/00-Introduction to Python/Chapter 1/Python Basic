>>The Python Interface<<

# Print 5 + 8
print(5 + 8)

# Print 7 + 10
print(7 + 10)

>>When to use Python?<<
All of the above

>>Any comments?<<
# Division
print(5 / 8)

# Addition
print(7 + 10)

>>Python as a calculator<<
# Addition, subtraction
print(5 + 5)
print(5 - 5)

# Multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation
print(3 * 5)
print(10 / 2)
print(18 % 7)
print(4 ** 2)

# How much is your $100 worth after 7 years?
print(100 * 1.1 ** 7)

>>Variable Assignment<<
# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Print out savings
print(savings)

>>Calculations with variables<<
# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Create a variable growth_multiplier
growth_multiplier = 1.1

# Calculate result
result = savings * growth_multiplier ** 7

# Print out result
print(result)

>>Other variable types<<
# Create a variable desc
desc = 'compound interest'
type(desc)

# Create a variable profitable
profitable = True
type(profitable)

>>Guess the type<<
a is of type float, b is of type str, c is of type bool

>>Operations with other types<<
savings = 100
growth_multiplier = 1.1
desc = "compound interest"

# Assign product of growth_multiplier and savings to year1
year1 = savings * growth_multiplier

# Print the type of year1
print(type(year1))

# Assign sum of desc and desc to doubledesc
doubledesc = desc + desc

# Print out doubledesc
print(doubledesc)

>>Type conversion<<
# Definition of savings and result
savings = 100
result = 100 * 1.10 ** 7

# Fix the printout
print("I started with $" + str(savings) + " and now have $" + str(result) + ". Awesome!")

# Definition of pi_string
pi_string = "3.1415926"

# Convert pi_string into float: pi_float
pi_float = float(pi_string)

>>Can Python handle everything?<<
"The correct answer to this multiple choice exercise is answer number " + 2

End.
